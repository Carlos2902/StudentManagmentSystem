# StudentManagmentSystem
 The catalog I've developed is a simple example of how you can use vectors and classes in C++ to create an application that stores and manages student information.
Vectors are a very useful data structure in C++, allowing multiple elements to be stored and accessed sequentially. In this case, we have used a vector to store the students that are added to the catalog, thus allowing its subsequent manipulation.
